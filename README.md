# Github Repo containing files and work for ASE 381P Drop Drone RL Project

## Git Quick Command List (personal preferences there are many more as well)
* git status - tells you current branch and status of files
* git pull - updates current branch to most recent pushed commit
* git add . - adds all files in current directory
* git commit -am "message" - creates new commit with message
* git push - pushes code to repo and saves on cloud
* git stash - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-stash

  ## TODO:
  * Implement wind dynamics
  * Discrete action for blade deployment
  * Limit drop location based off projectile motion then implement policy
